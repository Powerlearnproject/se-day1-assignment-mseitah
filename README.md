Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-  Conduct high leveled and detaileddesigns of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building software in accordance to design
Testing -  Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing software to users
Maintenance -  Providing ongoing support, updates and enhanceent to software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards while agile is the interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change Waterfall is more appropriate when a project must meet strict regulations and agile is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look before they start

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes and implements software solutions
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive toolsfor writing, debuugging, testing code.An example Visual studio.
VCs are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines which can ne overcome by prioritization of tasks
Changing requirements.Requirements may change during the development cycle which can be overcome using agile methodologies.
 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing involves testing individual components of software.
Intergration  testing involves testing interactions between different subsystems.
System Testing involve stesting entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing involves testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It helps to avoid getting confuusing answers to questions by making the questions clear and specific.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Show me an example of a CV"

" Show me an example of an entry level data scientist's CV"
